# Maths foundations for ML

## Getting Started

Jupyter notebooks with code about how to work with math functions on Python Frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and libraries such as Numpy.

> Intellectual information (concepts, explanations, and others) will be accessible on Google Drive using Samsung Notes on Spanish.

------------

### Prerequisites

Install the following tools to see, edit and, run the scripts into the notebooks.

- [Python](https://python.org)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)

Frameworks and libraries listed in the requirements file are:

- PyTorch
- Tensorflow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

Install all libraries for Python 3.12 with the command:
